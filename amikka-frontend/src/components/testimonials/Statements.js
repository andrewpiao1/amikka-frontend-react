        statement: `I can't say it enough. Amikka tutoring is great. They were responsive, professional and produced results. My daughter started off missing more than 50% of the presented SAT test prep questions and now six weeks later misses less than 5%. Additionally, she completed a SAT practice test and scored a 1500 equivalent just last week. She now looks forward to the real SAT in a few days with confidence instead of dread. This service is well worth the time and expense.`

        statement: 'Ammika Tutoringâ€™s approach to test taking is completely different than any other program I put my son through. He did Kaplan, Princeton, and Wyzant for a while and only improved 100 points from an 1100 to a 1200. On the other hand, Amikka program took me from a 1200 to a 1440. This score far exceeded what both my son and I thought he was going to achieve. According to him, a huge component of his success, besides the program, is the way that his confidence grew by becoming self aware of his weaknesses through the tutors at amikka and working to fix them one at a time.'

He worked with my schedule to come up with the best plan for me to reach my fullest potential with the SAT, allowing me to feel extremely confident and capable of doing well by the exam day. One thing that I felt really made my tutoring experience with him different was all the different ways that he was capable of explaining the various types of problems on the SAT. Christopher knew the answer to all of my questions about any of the problems that would be in the exams and would work with me until I fully understood them.'
